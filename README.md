# connect-fourest

connect-4 RL agent evaluator using [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/classic/connect_four/)

* Clone this repo locally
* Copy the `evaluator.py` and `eval_env.py` into your agent repo
* The key is that your agent's `act()` function MUST take in `observation` from environment as defined by PettingZoo (`mask` as well if you wish to action mask).
* Implement all three `# TODO:...` blocks in `evaluator.py`
* Run the copied `evaluator.py` file in your repo to evaluate your agent.
